# Scout API - Product One Pager

## What it solves

Scout API provides a secure and role-based backend for football talent discovery workflows:
- player profile and opportunity discovery
- application lifecycle management
- team-player messaging
- media upload and portfolio review

## Core value

1. Faster matching: teams and players move through a single structured flow.
2. Better trust: auth/session hardening, audit visibility, and security checks are built in.
3. Better operations: runbooks, monitoring hooks, and release gates reduce launch risk.

## Key capabilities

- Role-based APIs (`player`, `team`, manager/coaching roles)
- Opportunity filtering/sorting/pagination
- Incoming/outgoing application workflows
- Contact inbox/sent streams with status updates
- Media upload/list/delete with role controls
- Session/device management and token refresh flows

## Why now

- Manual scouting and fragmented communication increase response time and error rates.
- Clubs need traceable and secure flows before scaling candidate volume.
- Product is launch-ready with CI gates, UAT sign-off, and operational runbooks.

## Delivery confidence

- Backup/restore and rollback procedures documented
- UAT and accessibility pass documented
- Release candidate gate workflow in place
